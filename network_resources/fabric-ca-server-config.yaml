#  The registry section controls how the fabric-ca-server does two things:
#  1) authenticates enrollment requests which contain a username and password
#     (also known as an enrollment ID and secret).
#  2) once authenticated, retrieves the identity's attribute names and
#     values which the fabric-ca-server optionally puts into TCerts
#     which it issues for transacting on the Hyperledger Fabric blockchain.
#     These attributes are useful for making access control decisions in
#     chaincode.
#  There are two main configuration options:
#  1) The fabric-ca-server is the registry.
#     This is true if "ldap.enabled" in the ldap section below is false.
#  2) An LDAP server is the registry, in which case the fabric-ca-server
#     calls the LDAP server to perform these tasks.
#     This is true if "ldap.enabled" in the ldap section below is true,
#     which means this "registry" section is ignored.

# Affiliations section. Fabric CA server can be bootstrapped with the
# affiliations specified in this section. Affiliations are specified as maps.
# For example:
#   businessunit1:
#     department1:
#       - team1
#   businessunit2:
#     - department2
#     - department3
#
# Affiliations are hierarchical in nature. In the above example,
# department1 (used as businessunit1.department1) is the child of businessunit1.
# team1 (used as businessunit1.department1.team1) is the child of department1.
# department2 (used as businessunit2.department2) and department3 (businessunit2.department3)
# are children of businessunit2.
# Note: Affiliations are case sensitive except for the non-leaf affiliations
# (like businessunit1, department1, businessunit2) that are specified in the configuration file,
# which are always stored in lower case.
